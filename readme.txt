Code Structure

How to Run Code:
    On line 4 in main.m
        shape = 'heart';
        
    The list of shapes that can be drawn are
        1. 'line'
        2. 'square'
	3. 'triangle'
        3. 'circle'
        4. 'cosine'
        5. 'heart'
    Alternatively, the "use_image" variable can be set to true and a path specified in the if statement that uses it to draw the edges found in that image

    Run main.m in Matlab to draw specified shape.
